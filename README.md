# Predicting Box Office Revenue

This is the first project I completed during the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps). The purpose of the project was to use a linear regression model to predict a movie's domestic box office revenue. Data used in the model was obtained from the following sources:
* [boxofficemojo.com](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) - scraped to obtain movie-level data (budget, relesase date, etc)
* [IMDb](imdb.com) - scraped to supplement budget data when not available from boxofficemojo.com
* [Netflix](https://www.netflixinvestor.com/ir-overview/profile/default.aspx) - subscriber info as indicator of consumer demand for streaming services
* Cinemark Holdings stock price history - indicator of consumer demand for going to the movies
* US GDP - indicator of overall economic health
